# CS-GOExternalCheat
This is a simple CS:GO Cheat that is used for study purpouse

This source code is open to anyone who wants to change the code to make it work better.
Just start a new branch and I'll look into it.

I'm using this code to study how Valve is trying to catch cheaters and how to help them to improve the VAC system.
If you are planing to use this code anywhere else feel free to do so, but refer me as the developer.

DO NOT CHEAT ON VALVE OFFICIAL SERVER KIDS.
I'm not responsible for the use of this software, if you get banned it's your problem =]
